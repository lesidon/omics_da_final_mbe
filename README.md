## Introduction

In this repository one can find the workflow for the final project of "Omics Data Analysis" course concerning the epigenome changes in mouse brain. Neuronal and glial cells demonstrate different pattern in chromatin structure (the difference can be found literally by eyes). The aim of the project is to elucidate changes in mouse epigenomic profile of neuronal and glial cell and try to use it for explanation of chromatin diversity.

Our goals:
1. To compare neuronal and glial H3K9me3 track around the H3K27me3 regions in neurons, to investigate Ring1B (PRC1) linkage with H3K27me3 marks - Alisa Fedorenko;
2. To detect significantly interacting regions (fithic) and to intersect it with H3K27me3 track, to identify H3K27ac track for open chromatin, to compare this track around the H3K27me3 - Leonid Sidorov;
3. To find out a correlation between compartments, TADs and gene expression - Ksenia Kubenko;
4. To explore chromatin difference in neuronal (NeuN+) and non-neuronal (NeuNâˆ’) nuclei (TADs density, loops prominence, compartment changes) - Ekaterina Kashuk.
