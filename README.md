# Mouse brain epigenome
<i>It is done by four MSc Skoltech studetns -- Alisa Fedorenko, Ekaterina Kashuk, Ksenia Kubenko, and Leonid Sidorov.</i>

## Introduction

In this repository one can find the workflow for the final project of "Omics Data Analysis" course concerning the epigenome changes in mouse brain. Neuronal and glial cells demonstrate different pattern in chromatin structure (the difference can be found literally by eyes). The aim of the project is to elucidate changes in mouse epigenomic profile of neuronal and glial cell and try to use it for explanation of chromatin diversity.

Our goals:
1. To explore chromatin difference in NeuN+ and NeuN- (TADs density, loops prominence, compartment changes);
2. To detect polycomb interacting regions (fithic+H3K27me3 track);
3. To compare neuronal and glial H3K9me3 tracks around the regions.
